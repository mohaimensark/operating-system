A thread and a process are both execution units in an operating system, but they differ in several key aspects:

Memory Space: Each process has its own memory space, while threads within a process share the same memory space. This means that each process operates independently, with its own data and variables, while threads can access the same variables and data structures.

Resource Usage: A process typically requires more resources, such as memory and system resources, than a thread. This is because a process has its own memory space, whereas threads share memory with the process that created them.

Scheduling: Threads within a process are scheduled by the operating system to share the same CPU time, whereas each process has its own scheduling. This means that multiple threads within a process can run simultaneously, whereas processes run independently of each other.

Communication: Threads within a process can communicate with each other directly and easily, as they share the same memory space. Processes, on the other hand, need to use inter-process communication mechanisms, such as pipes or sockets, to communicate with each other.

In summary, threads are lighter-weight than processes and are useful for parallelism within a single application, while processes are independent units of execution
